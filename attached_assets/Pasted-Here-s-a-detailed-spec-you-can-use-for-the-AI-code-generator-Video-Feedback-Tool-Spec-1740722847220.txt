### **Video Feedback Tool Specification**  

#### **Overview**  
Develop a web-based video feedback tool using the `video.js` library that allows users to:  
- Load a video from a provided **public URL**  
- Play the video in the browser  
- Add **timestamped comments** at various points on the video timeline  
- Click on a comment to **jump to the corresponding timestamp** in the video  

#### **Requirements**  

##### **1. Video Playback**  
- Use **video.js** to embed and control video playback.  
- Accept a **public video URL** as input and load it into the player.  
- Ensure the video plays smoothly in modern browsers without additional dependencies.  

##### **2. Timeline-based Commenting**  
- Allow users to add comments tied to specific timestamps in the video.  
- Display each comment in a list along with its timestamp.  
- Clicking a comment should update the videoâ€™s play position to the associated timestamp.  

##### **3. User Interface Layout**  
- The UI should be **split into two sections**:  
  - **Left Side:** Video player (using `video.js`).  
  - **Right Side:** Comments panel displaying the timestamped comments.  

##### **4. Comment Functionality**  
- A simple text input field where users can type a comment.  
- A button to **add the comment at the current video time**.  
- Display comments in a list, showing the **timestamp** and text.  
- Clicking a comment should **seek the video to the associated timestamp**.  

##### **5. No Database or Backend**  
- The tool should work **entirely on the frontend**.  
- Comments should be stored in **browser memory (state management)**.  

##### **6. UI Enhancements**  
- Show timestamps in `MM:SS` format next to each comment.  
- Highlight the currently active comment based on the videoâ€™s progress.  
- Provide basic styling for readability and usability.  

#### **Expected Behavior**  
1. User provides a **public URL** of a video.  
2. The video is loaded into the player.  
3. As the video plays, users can **add comments** tied to timestamps.  
4. Comments appear in a list on the right side of the screen.  
5. Clicking on a comment will **seek the video to that timestamp**.
